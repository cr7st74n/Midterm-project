        The Yurts at Pacific Trails
        What is a yurt?
        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened
        How are the yurts furnished?
        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
        What should I bring?
        Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.
